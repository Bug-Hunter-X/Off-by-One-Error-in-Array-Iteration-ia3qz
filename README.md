This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over an array. The `bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.java` provides the corrected version.  The error arises from using `i <= arr.length` in the loop condition, leading to an attempt to access an index beyond the array bounds. The solution uses `i < arr.length` to correct the iteration.
